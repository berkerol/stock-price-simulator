Generate a random stock chart or watch its progress. Based on [Random walk hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis) and influenced by [Geometric Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion): on top of random change, it uses random up/down trend and volatility that change with random periods. Hover over the chart to see price, change, trend and volatility on that day. Made with [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org).
